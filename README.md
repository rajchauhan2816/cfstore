<p>Bonik is a multi-purpose eCommerce template built with React Next.js aiming at faster performance, high code quality & SEO, etc.</p>

<p>We used styled-components and carefully created custom components so that we don't have to sacrifice performance. The styled component also provides an easy way to change the appearance of the entire website.</p>

<p>Bonik comes with 4 different shop versions (Superstore, Grocery delivery, Niche Market version 1, Niche Market version 2), And tons of inner pages including multivendor and user account.</p>
